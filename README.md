# Covid-19-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is split into four parts: <br>
- Part 1: Focusing on the research question: *How did masking policies change the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 1, 2020 through October 1, 2021?*, I would investigate Polk, Florida, US on how the confirmed cases changed during Feb 1, 2020 to Oct 1, 2021.
- Part 2: Extension Plan (TBD) 
- Part 3: Presentation (TBD)
- Part 4: Project Repository: The one you are looking at
